*You’ve learned when to move, when to vanish, and how to signal it in an instant.*

**As an action**, choose one willing ally you can see within 30 feet of you. That ally can use their reaction to **move up to their movement speed and use the Hide action**

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier. You regain all uses after you finish a long rest.
