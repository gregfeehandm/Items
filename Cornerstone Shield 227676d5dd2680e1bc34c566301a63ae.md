**Unattuned:**

1. **+2 AC bonus.** While holding this Shield, you have a +2 bonus to your Armor Class, in addition to the Shield's normal bonus to AC.
2. **Divine Communication.** This shield has 6 charges and can be used to contact the ancestors of the Cornerstone name. By placing this shield on the ground and performing a simple ritual for 1 minute, you can cast one of the following spells from it:
    - [Augury](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618882-augury?srsltid=AfmBOorxvPsSUTirWbDbWLO7RFElzuZYskwessUFTl0Lkpm5tZAslbMv) (expends 2 charges)
    - [Commune](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618987-commune) (expends 6 charges).

**The shield regains 1d6 charges at dawn.**

**Attuned:**
If you are attuned to the shield, you gain the following benefits:

1. **Blessing of So'car.** While attuned to this shield, **you can cast the Blade Ward (2024) and Resistance (2024) cantrips at will**. Note that casting either cantrip this way still requires concentration.
2. **Protective Field.** As a Reaction, when you or an ally you can see within 5 feet of you is targeted by an attack or makes a saving throw against an area of effect, you can use the Shield to create an immobile 5-foot Emanation originating from you. When the Emanation appears, any creatures or objects not fully contained within it are pushed into the nearest unoccupied spaces outside it. The attack or area of effect that triggered the Reaction has no effect on creatures and objects inside the Emanation **until the end of your next turn**. Nothing can pass into or out of the Emanation. A creature or object inside the Emanation can’t be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the Emanation damage anything outside it. Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
