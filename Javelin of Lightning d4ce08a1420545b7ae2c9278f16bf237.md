**Javelin (1d6, versatile)**

This javelin is a magic weapon.
When you hurl it and speak its command word, it transforms into a bolt of lightning, forming a line 5 feet wide that extends out from you to a target within 120 feet.

**Each creature in the line excluding you and the target = DC 13 DEX, 4d6 lightning on fail, 1/2 on success.**

The lightning bolt turns back into a javelin when it reaches the target.

**Make a ranged weapon attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes damage from the javelin plus 4d6 lightning damage.**

Once per day. It can still be used as a magic weapon.
