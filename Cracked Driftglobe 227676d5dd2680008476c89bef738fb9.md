A cracked drift globe found with a Hobgoblin in the [Cornerstone Tomb](https://www.notion.so/Cornerstone-Tomb-133676d5dd2680ae8b4ec0758b6f7bee?pvs=21). Unlike a standard driftglobe, this object is always pointed to a location South West of [Ashtengil](https://www.notion.so/Ashtengil-e1cd9482db1b4d64bb21e4d4815a8ef9?pvs=21) and is only capable of emanating light as if affected by the Light cantrip.

You can speak another command word as an action to make the illuminated globe rise into the air and float no more than 5 feet off the ground. The globe hovers in this way until you or another creature grasps it. If you move more than 60 feet from the hovering globe, it follows you until it is within 60 feet of you. It takes the shortest route to do so. If prevented from moving, the globe sinks gently to the ground and becomes inactive, and its light winks out.
