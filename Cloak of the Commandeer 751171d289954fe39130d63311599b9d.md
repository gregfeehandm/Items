A dark blue leather cloak with the insignia of the Lanmoore gryphon riders. Donning the cloak boosts your confidence on the battlefield and instills on you a sense of leadership.

**Twice per short rest** you can perform the following maneuvers:

**Bait and Switch**
When you're within 5 feet of a creature on your turn, you can and switch places with that creature, provided you spend at least 5 feet of movement and the creature is willing and isn't incapacitated. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. Until the start of your next turn, that creature's AC increases by your Charisma modifier.

**Maneuvering Attack**
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can maneuver one of your comrades into a more advantageous position. You choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target of your attack.
