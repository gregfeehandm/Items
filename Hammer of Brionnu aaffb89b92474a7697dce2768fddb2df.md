Light Hammer, Attunement (optional)

If you are attuned to this item, you have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Additionally, if this object is thrown, you can spend a bonus action to recall the hammer to your hand. Any creatures between you and the hammer when you recall it must make a DC 13 DEX saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 1d4+1 damage.

Alternatively, once per day, you can spend an hour infusing a suit of armor, a simple or martial weapon, or up to 10 pieces of ammunition with the magic of Brionnu. The item must be partially made of metal. Until the end of your next long rest or until you die, the object becomes a magic item, granting a +1 bonus to AC if it's armor or a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if it's a weapon. After using this feature, the hammer becomes a normal light hammer until after the creature that used it in this manner’s next long rest.

You must be proficient with smith’s tools to use this feature.
