*Your presence alone can quiet panic and restore order.*

You always have **Calm Emotions** prepared.

You can cast **Calm Emotions** a number of times equal to your **Charisma modifier** (minimum of once) without expending a spell slot. You regain all expended uses when you finish a **long rest**.
