An orb that appears to be made of lapis lazuli, it is etched with ancient elvish runes. When placed in the magic circle where the Storm King laid to rest, it would magnify tranquility over the weather for a number of miles. This is what gave Stillwater its name.

After the Storm King was defeated, the Durun tribe crafted the orb from the empathy [So’car](https://www.notion.so/So-car-7d09cf72e104447cafbcbf0e97d0df91?pvs=21) and gifted it to the humans as a sign of peace.
