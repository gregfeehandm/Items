*You know how to move unseen — and how to teach others to do the same.*

You know the **Pass Without a Trace** spell and can cast **it once per long rest** without expending a spell slot.

- When you cast the spell in this way, you can affect a number of creatures up to your **Dexterity modifier** (minimum of one).
- This spell does not count against your spells known or prepared.
