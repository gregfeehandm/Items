Attunement: Attuned
Inventory: Flint

This unpolished blue-gray stone is etched with simple transmutation runes by the wizard Gordash, who crafted it to help two clever rats defend his home. While attuned, the bearer can walk on water as though it were solid ground. Once per long rest, the bearer can also invoke the stone’s magic to cast *enlarge/reduce*.
