As long as you wear and are attuned to these bracers, you are **resistant to Lightning damage.**

The bracers have 3 charge slots. Whenever you are hit with elemental energy (Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison, Thunder), you can spend your Reaction to fill 1 slot.

Whenever you make a melee attack with a metal weapon or an unarmed strike, you can spend a charge to deal an additional 1d6 of lightning damage. This attack is considered magical. You can release as many charges as you have stored.
