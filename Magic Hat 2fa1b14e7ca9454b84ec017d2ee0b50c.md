*Requires attunement*

A funny-looking pointy hat, sorting hat style. 

Bevyn will refer to himself as a Great Wizard who was transformed by Cassius. Will point in the direction of the wand. 

**While attuned** to the hat, the wearer can ask the hat to cast Vicious Mockery (at will). Once per day, it can also cast Dissonant Whispers. The hat is sentient and may refuse to help depending on the situation and time of day. It is insightful, but not exceptionally. **The wearer can ask the hat for assistance with Arcana checks**.
