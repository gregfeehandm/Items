Wondrous item, uncommon

A lens which can easily be crafted to fit in a monocle. The lens reveals writings of Stonearm Amberfist’s shield, but can also be used to cast the *Identify* spell. Due to the nature of the enchantment, the spell can only be cast at the Ritual duration (10 minutes). Once the item has been used this way it cannot be used again until the next dawn.
