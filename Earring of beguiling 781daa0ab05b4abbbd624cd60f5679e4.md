Inventory: Dierro

This simple golden stud is adorned with three extravagant feathers from a bird uncommon in most lands. While wearing the item, you may expect peculiar glances from anyone who takes note of the item, regarding you as a mysterious traveler who has scoured the lands to find such an item. 

This earring has 3 charges. While attuned to this item, when you make a Charisma (Deception) or Charisma (Persuasion) check that relies on your “worldliness”, you can spend 1 charge to make the check with advantage. The earring regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

**ALT: Old**

The item has three charges. While attuned to the item, you can cast the Friends cantrip. Each time you cast the spell, 1 charge is used. If all three charges are used, one of the feathers falls from the earring and the earring becomes a simple item. The earring regains 1d4 charges at dawn.

**Friends**

You magically emanate a sense of friendship toward one visible creature within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Charmed condition for the duration. The target succeeds automatically if it isn’t a Humanoid, if you’re fighting it, or if you have cast this spell on it within the past 24 hours. The spell ends early if the target takes damage or if you make an attack roll, deal damage, or force anyone to make a saving throw.
