Requires attunement by a Cleric, Druid, or Paladin. 

This necklace has ___ magic beads made from aquamarine, black pearl, or topaz. It also has many nonmagical beads made from other stones. If a magic bead is removed from the necklace, that bead loses its magic.

To use a bead, you must be wearing the necklace. Each bead contains a spell that you can cast from it as a bonus Action (using your spell save DC if necessary). Once a magic bead's spell is cast, that bead can't be used again until the next dawn.
