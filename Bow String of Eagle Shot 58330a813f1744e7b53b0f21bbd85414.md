This bow string is a thin strand of adamantium and must be drawn taught. Before you make an attack with a ranged weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll. If that attack hits, you add +10 to the attack's damage.

Roll a d6. On a 6, this string can be used again. On a 5 or lower, the string warps and cannot be used again until is tightened as part of a long or short rest.
